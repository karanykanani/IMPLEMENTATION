In this project, develop a program that implements arithmetic with large integers, of arbitrary size.
Code base: Java library: Lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, hashing, trees. Do not use BigInteger, BigNum, or other libraries that implement arbitrary precision arithmetic.

Starter code: Num.java

Your task is to implement the class Num that stores and performs arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large integers. You must use the following data structure for representing Num: Array of long integers, where the digits are in the chosen base. In particular, do not use strings to represent the numbers. Each entry of the list stores exactly one long integer. The base is defined to be 10 in the starter code, but you may modify it. In the discussions below, we will use base = 10. For base = 10, the number 4028 is represented by the list: {8,2,0,4}. Implement all methods in the starter code. Some of them are:

Num(String s): Constructor for Num class; takes a string s as parameter, with a number in decimal, and creates the Num object representing that number in the chosen base. Note that, the string s is in base 10, even if the chosen base is not 10. The string s can have arbitrary length.
Num(long x): Constructor for Num class.
String toString(): convert the Num class object into its equivalent string (in decimal). There should be no leading zeroes in the string.
Num add(Num a, Num b): sum of two numbers a+b stored as Num.
Num subtract(Num a, Num b): a-b
Num product(Num a, Num b): product of two numbers a*b.
Num power(Num x, long n): given an Num x, and n, returns the Num corresponding to x^n (x to the power n). Assume that n is a nonnegative number. Use divide-and-conquer to implement power using O(log n) calls to product and add.
printList(): Print the base + ":" + elements of the list, separated by spaces.
Num divide(Num a, Num b): Integer division a/b. Use divide-and-conquer or division algorithm. Return null if b=0.
Num mod(Num a, Num b): remainder you get when a is divided by b (a%b). Assume that a is non-negative, and b > 0. Return null if b=0.
Num squareRoot(Num a): return the square root of a (truncated). Use binary search. Assume that a is non-negative. Return null if b < 0.
